Kernel Density Based Clustering

This project introduces a novel approach to clustering by leveraging Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) with various kernel functions to address the limitations of traditional density-based methods such as DBSCAN. KDE, a non-parametric technique, estimates data density distribution using kernel functions, enabling adaptive clustering that handles varying data densities and overlapping clusters effectively. The study evaluates the performance of clustering using Gaussian, Epanechnikov, and other kernel functions, highlighting improved cluster precision and adaptability to complex data patterns. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of kernel-based clustering in achieving higher silhouette scores compared to DBSCAN, particularly in datasets with irregular density distributions. This research lays the foundation for flexible, density-adaptive clustering methods suitable for diverse real-world applications.
